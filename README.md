# Overview

I used Unreal Engine to make Minecraft!

This is not my idea, nor my program. I don't intend to make a knockoff of the game, nor monetize its production for my personal income. In fact, I followed a tutorial by [Deprived Productions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7HRB-YIUrG29zufq-vURsw), found here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ7R1eB0AmM-1duebqThOg0zsjESkSmkj

The game is very basic. Currently, in this first commit, only basic player movement, ground generation and block placement have been implemented in the game.

My purpose for writing this software is for education purposes. I now know a lot about Unreal Engine and modern-day game mechanics implementation.

Below is a link to the demonstration video for my software.

# Development Environment

[Unreal Engine 4.26.1](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/?sessionInvalidated=true)

Using this program required use of knowledge in how to organize 3-Dimensional assets, UE Blueprints and some aspects of animation. I didn't use the UE API with C++, although this is an option.

# Future Work

Implement further gameplay, block destruction, and do bug fixes.
